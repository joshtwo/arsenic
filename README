This is a Haskell bot for dAmn (deviantART Messaging Network). To install this, run the following:

    $ git clone git://github.com/joshtwo/arsenic.git
    $ cd arsenic
    $ cabal update  # Update the list of packages cabal knows about
    $ cabal install

This will download, compile, and install a fresh copy of Arsenic from source. This assumes that you have both a Haskell compiler, such as GHC, and Cabal-install, which comes standard with the Haskell Platform.
